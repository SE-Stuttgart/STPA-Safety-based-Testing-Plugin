ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&amp;apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&amp;quot;Contribution&amp;quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &amp;apos;originates&amp;apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&amp;apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA;&amp;quot;Contributor&amp;quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&amp;quot;Licensed Patents&amp;quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&amp;quot;Program&amp;quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&amp;quot;Recipient&amp;quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2.

As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&amp;apos;s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;3.
